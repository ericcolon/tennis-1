title:  Monte Carlo field set
---

The field is set for Monte Carlo 2016.  A fairly tough draw for Novak Djokovic,
as he ends up in the same half as Roger Federer (tough draw for Federer too, of
course), meaning that he will likely have to defeat both Federer and Murray for
the title.  He's still the favorite, certainly, but Federer and Murray have a
better combined shot at the title (55%) than Djokovic (41%).  Everyone else is a
major dark horse.

In other news, rising star David Goffin (+0.9 over the last year) has a very
tough first round matchup against Feliciano Lopez, although if he can get past the first round, has a good shot of facing Djokovic in the quarters.
